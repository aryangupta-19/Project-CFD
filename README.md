# Project-CFD
I am trying to make frontend of a CFD Trading website using React and Material UI.

I used React and MUI based on web application that simulates Contract for Difference (CFD) trading in a simple and interactive way.
This project is built from scratch to help users understand market behavior, manage virtual portfolios, and analyze trade performance — all in one place.

Features

Real-time market simulation with dummy asset data.
Portfolio tracking – view balance, open trades, and profits.
Trade history – keep record of all executed trades.
Responsive UI – designed with React & Material UI.
About & Disclaimer page for realistic app touch.
Polished interface with smooth animations and effects.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
