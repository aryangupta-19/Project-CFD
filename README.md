# Project-CFD
I am trying to make frontend of a CFD Trading website using React and Material UI.

I used React and MUI based on web application that simulates Contract for Difference (CFD) trading in a simple and interactive way.
This project is built from scratch to help users understand market behavior, manage virtual portfolios, and analyze trade performance — all in one place.

Features

Real-time market simulation with dummy asset data.
Portfolio tracking – view balance, open trades, and profits.
Trade history – keep record of all executed trades.
Responsive UI – designed with React & Material UI.
About & Disclaimer page for realistic app touch.
Polished interface with smooth animations and effects.
